    <h2 class = h2>About me</h2>
    <img src="Mock_images/me_drawing.jpg" alt="This is me" width="30%">
    <p>
    I’m Dom… an illustrator, designer and now (bit by bit) an aspiring junior code developer. I have a long history in running live events and all that theatre magic from orchestrating people playing their guitars in front of people venting about their ex-lover to staging a fake take over by revolutionaries of a stage production.
    </p>
    <p>
    Whilst it was flamboyant at times, people forget such endeavours relied upon cold hard logistics… no point putting on a show if those that watching it don’t know where to sit!
    </p>
    <p>
    Two of my favourite downtime interests is gaming and rpg games. I adore story crafting and enjoy creating new stories and adventures with groups of people.

    <h2 class = heading>Why am I studying with Code Nation?</h2>
        <p>With spending most of my career in events and theatre, like many, my world was spun upside down with the pandemic and I began thinking about what I would like to do instead.</p>
        <p>Apart from live events I have a background in illustration and design. From some time in dabbling with code I've always wanted to pair my design skills with coding. It's because of these interests and seeing the opportunities offered by Code Nation that made me want to see what different path I could take.</p>

    <h2 class = heading>My learning targets</h2>
        <p>Over this course I hope to learn the tools and techniques to develop my abilities to web design further. I'm also hoping I'll get an idea if there's a possible future in working in the gaming industry!</p>
